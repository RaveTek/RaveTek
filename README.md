Okay well, the Eagler desktop version of 1.14 is gone. (reasons are below!) But well, there is still the web port!
New Project: Eaglercraft 1.16.5!
Old Project: Eagler 1.14 DESKTOP RUNTIME! Deleted because people think it was copied. I got it from archive.org, as portable minecraft 1.14. Then, i edited it. 
NOTICE:
I can not run MCP because gradle can not run its' clean tasks.
Some people think that I copied from things. So I deleted some repos that w/m be copied.
